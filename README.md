Child Support Network 

Problem Statement: 

In recent years, the need for support to children worldwide has grown multifold, especially after the COVID years and with the rising inflation affecting families and the children in NGOs/orphanages.  
A child support network is a system or network of resources that are available to assist with child support obligations. The Child Support Network brings together multiple organizations under its wing to offer enriched care to children in terms of their academic, and health including pharmacy agencies, non-profit organizations, Educational Services, and hospital community resources. This system enables NGOs to collaborate with schools, pharmacies, and hospitals can provide a comprehensive approach to caring for children in need. This approach can ensure that children receive the education, essentials, and healthcare support needed to thrive. Schools can provide a safe and nurturing environment for children to learn and grow. Pharmacies can play a vital role in providing essential supplies such as food, clothing, and medicine for children in need. Hospitals can provide medical care and support for children who may be sick or have medical conditions that require attention.
